# RISC V Processor

RISC-V CPU is a design that can run 11 different operation codes written in system verilog language.
## Results

When the developed RISC-V CPU processor meets the specified conditions, it can perform 11 commands and perform operations. </br>
The advantages of the processor being based on risc-v have been seen.</br>
It has been observed that the division of different units such as the constructor, the registers and the alu both accelerates and facilitates the project management. </br>
As a result, the RISC-V CPU processor can properly perform the desired operations with machine language codes.
